                            <p><strong><span>Frontend Development:</span></strong> I’m absolutely fascinated by web
                                development. I
                                love building interactive, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
                                feeling of solving problems with clean and efficient code is one of the best parts of
                                being a developer. Every project is a new opportunity to learn something new and push my
                                creative boundaries.</p>

                            <p><strong><span>Chess:</span></strong> Chess has been a huge part of my life. I’ve always
                                enjoyed the
                                mental challenge it brings. Whether I’m playing online or with friends, it’s a great way
                                to stimulate my brain and strategize in a calm, focused environment. I even follow major
                                chess tournaments to stay inspired and learn from the best players.</p>

                            <p><strong><span>Football:</span></strong> Football is one of my greatest passions. I love
                                watching with
                                friends whenever I get the chance and keeping up with my favorite teams. The adrenaline
                                of the game and the teamwork involved is something that truly excites me. I also enjoy
                                watching big matches and keeping up with leagues around the world.</p>

                            <p><strong><span>Music:</span></strong> Music is my escape. I can spend hours listening to
                                new tracks,
                                discovering new artists, or just getting lost in a good playlist. It’s not just about
                                listening—it’s about feeling the rhythm, the melodies, and the emotions behind the
                                songs. Whether it's rock, electronic, or jazz, there's always something new to vibe to.

                                It’s a perfect
                                mix of strategy, psychology, and luck. I enjoy playing online and with friends,
                                constantly learning new strategies, and testing my skills. There's always room to grow
                                and refine my gameplay, which is what keeps me coming back for more!</p>

                                shooters to immersive RPGs, I love getting lost in virtual worlds. Gaming allows me to

                                fan of TV series, especially thrillers, dramas, and comedies. Whether it’s on Netflix or
